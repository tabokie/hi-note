Learn to be Hired
=================

Network
-------

### Transport Layer

**HTTP connection**

-   HTTP/0.9 short connection
    -   each request = { DNS -\> three-step -\> transport -\> four-step
        }
-   HTTP/1.0 durable connection
    -   Connection Field = Keep-Alive / Close
    -   timeout = 5, max = 100
    -   Implementation
        -   1.  hold active processes until exaustion of pid

        -   2.  IO multuplexing

        -   3.  hold thread and buffer request until data is ready

    -   Application
        -   1.  response on request

        -   2.  (长轮询) on request, server will wait for data ready or
                timeout

        -   3.  (Comet HTTP stream) continously send data to client
-   HTTP/1.1 pipelined connection
    -   default Keep-Alice
    -   Head-of-Line-Blocking(HOLB) problem
