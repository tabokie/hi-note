# hi-note

Inspired by `literate programming` and `SQL relational language`, hi-note is a note-taking language that provides intrinsic grammar for structured noting and reference/alert/completion.

project still in plan. For now, it's a simple markdown notes archive ;).

## Feature (in-plan)

* [ ] Comfortable grammar that combines writing's self-explained logic with program's loose-coupled structuring ability.
* [ ] Light-Weight compiler that parses hi-note program into compact notes and meta data. Meta data includes modification time, tag, auther, etc. Also, its fallback version can analyse markdown and plain text.
* [ ] Storage backend with support for analytical query.
* [ ] Documentation backend that converts internal notes into well-laid docs.
* [ ] Handy toolsets including memo alert, plans, smart editor, etc.

## Notes

Before hi-note is ready for use, I put my on-going notes in Markdown here.
